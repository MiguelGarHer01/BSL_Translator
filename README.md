# BSL translator

ritish Sign Language (BSL) serves as the primary mode of communication for many deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in the UK.
Recognizing the need for accessible communication solutions, this study
introduces a BSL Translator. This translator leverages the Mediapipe
computer vision framework in conjunction with a Long Short Term
Memory classifier to accurately recognize and interpret BSL expressions. The research begins with an extensive review of literature,
providing insights into the existing landscape of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) technologies. A technical review follows, outlining the
methodology employed, including the integration of computer vision
and machine learning techniques. A prototype of the BSL Translator
is then designed and developed based on the findings from the preceding sections. Remarkably, the prototype achieves a processing time
of 0.05 seconds, demonstrating promising results for real-time SLR
applications. Moving forward, the prototype will undertake rigorous
evaluation to assess its effectiveness compared to existing research in
the field. This research aims to contribute to the advancement of communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community,
attempting to bridge existing communication gaps through innovative
technological solutions.
